          Hey there! I'm Ryan Hill, a full-stack senior software engineer based
          in Colorado. When I'm not coding, I'm usually hanging out with my
          family, playing with my dog, Penny, or hitting some tennis balls. You
          also might find me baking some homemade sourdough bread 👀.

          Once upon a time, I even was even an (office) ping pong 🏓 champion 🏆
        </p>
        {/* add image of ping pong */}
        <p className="my-2">
          I've been coding for over 9 years and have worked with a wide variety
          of technologies. I'm currently focused on building web applications
          with React, TypeScript, and Node.js.
