        <p className="my-4">
          Hey there! I'm Ryan Hill, a full-stack senior software engineer based
          in Colorado. When I'm not coding, I'm usually hanging out with my
          family, playing with my dog, Penny, or hitting some tennis balls. You
          also might find me baking some homemade sourdough bread ðŸ‘€.
        </p>
        {/* add image of penny */}
        <p className="my-4">
          Once upon a time, I even was even a ping pong champion.
        </p>
        {/* add image of ping pong */}
        <p className="my-2">
          I've been coding for over 9 years and have worked with a variety of
          technologies. I'm currently focused on building web applications with
          React, TypeScript, and Node.js.
